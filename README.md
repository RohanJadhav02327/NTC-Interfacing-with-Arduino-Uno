# NTC-Interfacing-with-Arduino-Uno
This repository contains code for interfacing NTC temperature sensor with Arduino Uno.
This uses Steinhart-hart equation for deriving relation between temperature and resistance.
Connect Output of voltage divider circuit to A5 Pin of Arduino Uno
Use 10k resister for voltage divider R1 and NTC has 10k resistance
